Scripts, modules, aliases, functions and some other interesting stuff with PowerShell. Some challenges and playing with my PC.

Two groups of IT pros were given a written test without access to a computer to determine their skill level with PowerShell. PowerShell beginners were placed in one group and experts in another. Based on the results of the test, there didn't seem to be much difference in the skill level between the two groups. Both groups were given a second test similar to the first one. This time they were given access to a computer with PowerShell that didn't have access to the internet. The results of the second test showed a huge difference in the skill level between the two groups. Experts don't always know the answers, but they know how to figure out the answers.

What was the difference in the results of the first and second test between these two groups?

The differences observed in these two tests were because experts don't memorize how to use thousands of commands in PowerShell. They learn how to use the help system within PowerShell extremely well. This allows them to find the necessary commands when needed and how to use those commands once they've found them.
